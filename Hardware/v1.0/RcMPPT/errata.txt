RcMPPT Hardware Errata Sheet

#1 Buck Converter Module not supplied via diode
	The 5V Buck Converter act like a diode when supplied from the output side
	therefore hindering the output to sink below 5V when supplied only via usb

#2 Unsymmetric supply of the buck converter
	Powerup is only possible when battery is connected

#3 Low side charge pump not connected via 2 diodes
	This shorted buck and boost side together therefore killing the gate drivers

#4 Low side charge pump not cheaper / smaller than boost controller

#5 SBUS not inverted
	SBUS is implemented as inverted UART so it should be inverted on board

#6 Non Bi-Directional Shunt Amplifier
	This makes it hard to detect current flow in the wrong direction and accurate measurements
	at low currents.
